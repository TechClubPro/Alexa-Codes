keys_Action={"first":["imgSpch","Newton's first law states that, if a body is at rest or moving at a constant speed in a straight line, it will remain at rest or keep moving in a straight line at constant speed unless it is acted upon by a force. This postulate is known as the law of inertia.","first"], 
             "second":["imgSpch","The second law states that the rate of change of momentum of an object is directly proportional to the force applied, or, for an object with constant mass, that the net force on an object is equal to the mass of that object multiplied by the acceleration.","second"], 
             
             "rocket":["imgSpch","Newton's Third Law states that 'every action has an equal & opposite reaction'. In a rocket, burning fuel creates a push on the front of the rocket pushing it forward. This creates an equal & opposite push on the exhaust gas backwards.","rocket"],
             "atom":["imgSpch","An atom is the smallest unit of ordinary matter that forms a chemical element. Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms. Atoms are extremely small, typically around 100 picometers across.","atom"], 
             
             "electricity":["imgSpch"," Electricity is a fundamental form of energy observable in positive and negative forms that occurs naturally (as in lightning) or is produced (as in a generator) and that is expressed in terms of the movement and interaction of electrons.","elec"],
             "water":["imgSpch","Water can occur in three states: solid (ice), liquid, or gas (vapor).","water"],             
             "gravity":["imgSpch","Gravity or gravitation, is a natural phenomenon by which all things with mass or energy—including planets, stars, galaxies, and even light[2]—are brought toward (or gravitate toward) one another. On Earth, gravity gives weight to physical objects, and the Moon's gravity causes the ocean tides.","gravity"],
